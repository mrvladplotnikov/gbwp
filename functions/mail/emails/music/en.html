Hello!
<br />
<br />
Before we move on to the cost of our music composing packages, you need to know
that each of them is «based on real events» from previous projects and is ready
to work for your product and audience. :)
<br />
<br />
<h4>Standard: The naming is boring, the package is cool</h4>
<ul>
  <li>completion — up to 7 business days;</li>
  <li>five free edits;</li>
  <li>50% prepayment. Cost: <b>€340/min + €180*</b></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4>Soft Launch: Testing your hypotheses</h4>
<ul>
  <li>track duration — 30 sec.;</li>
  <li>completion — up to 5 business days;</li>
  <li>five free edits;</li>
  <li>50% prepayment;</li>
  <li>
    upon further ordering of Standard / Premium packages for the same track,
    Soft Launch price is included. Cost: <b>€180</b>
  </li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4>S.O.S: When everything is burning</h4>
<ul>
  <li>completion — ASAP;</li>
  <li>no edits;</li>
  <li>full prepayment. Cost: <b>€310/min + €180*</b></li>
</ul>
<br />
<h4>Premium: Yes, you're on a horse</h4>
<ul>
  <li>completion — ASAP;</li>
  <li>five free edits;</li>
  <li>50% prepayment. Cost: <b>€450/min + €180**</b></li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
The additional €180 indicated in the Standard, S.O.S, and Premium packages are
the cost of composing each subsequent minute after the first one.
<br />
<br />
The price of each package includes the transfer of intellectual property rights.
However, there will be some limits on:
<ul>
  <li>
    free resale and re-release of compositions outside the project they were
    composed for;
  </li>
  <li>monetization from streaming services and marketplaces.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<br />
If necessary, we can transfer to you all exclusive intellectual property rights
without any restrictions, but this should be discussed separately. In this case,
the total cost of the project will be higher.
<br />
<br />
If you are not sure which package suits best for your project, or you have other
questions, be sure to

you!
