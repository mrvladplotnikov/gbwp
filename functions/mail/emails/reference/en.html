  >this template</a
>.
<br />
<br />
We have been using our template for several years, and with its help, we have
completed more than a dozen projects. During this time, we managed to improve it
so that it would be as simple as possible for you to create the right technical
task.

We intentionally prefilled the template with information, so you will
immediately understand what is what. Moreover, you will find a lot of comments
in the document to guide you.

<br />
If you have any questions, be sure to write to us. We'd be happy to help!
