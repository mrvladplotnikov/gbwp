Do you know how one song can entirely change your mood?</p><p>Just a couple of notes, the correct rhythmic pattern, and a person is now ready for great deals. And then you slightly change the arrangement, and the very same person is now suddenly all in sad memories. It fascinates and captures us, and makes us do what we do every day. Listen, study and, ultimately, compose music.</p>",
